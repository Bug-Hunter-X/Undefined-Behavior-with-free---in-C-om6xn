This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming: using the `free()` function on a pointer that was not allocated dynamically using functions like `malloc()`, `calloc()`, or `realloc()`.  Attempting to free memory that wasn't allocated dynamically results in undefined behavior, which can manifest in various ways, including program crashes or subtle memory corruption. The `bug.c` file illustrates the problematic code, while `bugSolution.c` provides a corrected version.
